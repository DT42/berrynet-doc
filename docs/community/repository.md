# What is BerryNet Repository

Our goal is to push BerryNet SW components into Debian repository as many as possible. Before the process is completed, or some components will not be accepted because of Debian policy violation (e.g. close sourced OpenVINO SDK), you can install these SW components from [BerryNet repository](https://github.com/DT42/BerryNet-repo).

BerryNet repository will be set automatically in the installation process. To configure BerryNet repository manually, please refer to [BerryNet repository](https://github.com/DT42/BerryNet-repo).

Besides of BerryNet itself, there are many useful packages:

* ML/DL models
* AI frameworks
* Pre-built OpenCV
* Freeboard
